# Digital-Image-Processing
This Repository contains all my solution of Assignments of course E9 241:Digital Image Processing (2020).<br/>

## Assignment - 1 <br/>
1. Histogram Computation: Compute the histogram of the image coins.png. Verify your
result using the MATLAB built-in function hist. <br/>

2. Otsu’s Binarization Algorithm. <br/>

3. Separate the foreground text from the background
using binarization. <br/>

4. Design a function in matlab/python count_connected_components.m(/.py) which
counts the number of characters excluding punctuations. <br/>

5. Write a function binary_morphology.m(/.py) which performs binarization to separate the foreground text from noisy background and returns a clean binary image of the text without noise.<br/>

## Assignment - 2 <br/>
1. Point Operations : <br/>
   a. Linear Contrast Stretching.<br/>
   b. Power Law Contrast Strtching.<br/>
   c. Histogram Equalization.<br/>
   d. Contrast Limited Histogram Equalisation (CLAHE).<br/>
   
2. Saturated Contrast Stretching: In this method the histogram of each R,G,B channel is stretched to the range of 0-255. To achieve this, assign a certain percentage of brightest pixels to 255 and certain percentage of darkest pixels to 0. Then perform linear contrast stretching.<br/>

3. Resizing an Image: Write a function resize.m (or resize.py) that accepts a grayscale image, resizing factor and a string (‘nearest’ for Nearest Neighbour interpolation and ‘bilinear’ for bilinear interpolation) as input and returns the resized image.<br/>

4. Image Rotation: Write a function ImgRotate.m (or ImgRotate.py) that accepts an image,
degree of rotation (in the counter clockwise direction with respect to the x-axis) and a string (‘nearest’ for Nearest Neighbour interpolation and ‘bilinear’ for bilinear interpolation) as input and returns the rotated image.
