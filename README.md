This Repository contains all my solution of Assignments of course E9 241:Digital Image Processing (2020).<br/>

## Assignment - 1 <br/>
1. Histogram Computation: Compute the histogram of the image coins.png. Verify your
result using the MATLAB built-in function hist. <br/>

2. Otsuâ€™s Binarization Algorithm. <br/>

3. Separate the foreground text from the background
using binarization. <br/>

4. Design a function in matlab/python count_connected_components.m(/.py) which
counts the number of characters excluding punctuations. <br/>

5. Write a function binary_morphology.m(/.py) which performs binarization to separate the foreground text from noisy background and returns a clean binary image of the text without noise.<br/>
